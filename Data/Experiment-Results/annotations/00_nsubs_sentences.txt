I usually dont get tired till about 2 hour b4 I have to get up.
i got it and when i started playing i started to think 'this game is for girls' (the macho man in me)  if u do get it i would also strongly recommend u to play at least 4 hrs of it b4 u let it go
No it's part of the game since b4 2007
So I made a new character and got my d00d to Level 90, but I wanted to mix it up and go about accomplishing feats and quests in a more comprehensive way
Tacticool Cosplaying Sealteam6 d00dz who attach so much bulky shit to the rails that they can't hold the weapon without one
i know a lot of people i used to play with quit because of the early access heroes and the amount of new heroes that powercreeped the originals, make a classic game mode with ~2009 hero selection would be gr8
RFC is good item only when u aint going  4 crit build, cuz it gives u good flat stats + and gr8 range, yet since vayne is about 3shot enemy squishy with 1-2 crits in this, u need 2 go into PD or static, 2 provide that good burst
w00t I want to switch between my virtualized desktops using the 3d cube.
There are 46^8 passwords possible, but you start with words, then you do words with numbers or symbols around them, then you do words with l33t substitutions, then you do words with l33t substitutions and symbols around them.    It's probably only feasible if you've got the hash of the password, because attempting that many logins would probably take forever

Too many kiddies thinking they're going to go pro by "being the best Genji evar l00k at my 200 hours on h1m" so sorry but under 1% of the player base ever makes it to pro status, and wake up call, no team would ever want someone that can only play a Hanzo or a Genji or a Tracer

If you plan on playing online with other human beings there's 2 rules to follow:  1: D0NT SHOOT! Just because you have the ball doesn't mean you need to score
1f u d0n7 (?) 1n 420 seconds u wi11 (?)!!?!!?1???!11??!one1?
D00d $30 is heaps cheap, that must work out to just a couple of bucks an hour
Tapped on the shoulder by the baton, sorry, ur not cool, ur not smart, and this is actually code that u smell like bad cheese! Now every1 knows!  Post this on 10 other uni subreddits, or ur gonna get tapped on the shoulder by a baton when u graduate!
But since ti3 with the winning of A and their 'Rat Strat', every1 start give more attention to draft/strategy part of the game (items, lane, all push, jungle, split push etc)
Also, is keeping my Malygos worth for anything or should I dust for the sw33t 1600?
I also hope my 2 little puppies live 4ever
Despite 40$ 4ever covfefe, we are all Monero
at the top, I met with the ancient monks of gaming, who challenged me to three games: pong, street fighter 2, and halo (the last monk just got his title, all  the others call him n00b since he is only 150 years old and plays halo)  after defeating them all, I had to speed run through Ghosts n goblins, all the Mario games, the original donkey kong, and battletoads
Besides waiting 3 weeks and if no hatch action, you have a unfertilized egg? hmm      Guess I'm just an egg n00b
In other words, we only have to build 99 more before we can call the Sun a stupid n00b
Why would the govt blow up WTC 7, when all it would take to bring their conspiracy to light is some n00bz on the internet?    The building had to fall some way, and it happened to fall "symmetrically", whatever that's supposed to mean concerning building collapses.
This doesn't make sense m8 liquid got top 4 and 2nd at back to back majors
# 7 confirmed thx m8
10+ hours a day ? Are u retarded m8 the server would be done already if that was the case that would be over 1000 hours already and there no way the did that :3

I'll w8 for other offers They still going for around 80?
someone kaijued a towers when kaijus were just realised and everyone was like w8 can you actually kill the most problematic monster of 2015 just like that? not that insane right now but at the time it was crazy

halberd can be g00d but u needed silveredge and satanic in place 0f pike&halberd , b0th 0f th0se items are g00d but in late game u need best p0ssible items , silveredge against bkb sven / tide is awes0me & with bkb its certain satanic will c0me in play 9/10 times if n0t i'll suggest linkens instead 0f silveredge (satanic and silveredge b0th b00st y0ur damage insanely and with bkb its reliable and u can 1vs3 , if u didnt get c0ntr0lled)
Will checl later 2day!

Ah, is that a new form of 1337 5p34k I see? How rad of you to share it with us, m4d 5k1llz, my human friend, m4d 5k1llz.
I bet the very friendly manager would also let someone with heavy bleeding die if they asked to use the phone to call an ambulance.    *with nasal voice*    Sorry, but rul3z is rul3z.

l3rn 2 rite proper    Also, putting lol in capitals, when you'd normally put it in lower-case does not a powerful argument make.
